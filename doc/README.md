Xuez Core
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[Xuez Core](http://github.com/xuez/xuez/releases) is the original Xuez client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Xuez transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Xuez on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/xuez-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/xuezd (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/xuez-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/xuezd (headless, 64-bit)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run xuez-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag Xuez-Qt to your applications folder, and then run Xuez-Qt.
